                    <p>
                        The D.I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) is the leading organization in Russia for fundamental research in metrology and development of state measuring standards. Its primary activity is to ensure national and international uniformity of measurements, which are the key components of domestic industry development and economic growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VNIIM succeeds one of the oldest in the world and the first in Russia State Metrology Institution, the Depot of Weights and Measures (founded on June 16, 1842). Upon the initiative of Dmitry Mendeleyev, who headed the Depot from 1892 to 1907, it was transformed into the Main Chamber of Weights and Measures on June 20, 1893. In 1934, it was renamed the All-Russian Research Institute for Metrology (VNIIM). Since 1947, the Institute bears the name of Dmitry Mendeleyev. In 1971, it was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour .
                        Since 1994, VNIIM qualifies as the State Scientific Centre of the Russian Federation, as well as the Scientific Methodological Center of the State Service of Certified Reference Materials for Composition and Properties of Matters and Materials. VNIIM is a part of the defense industry of Russia. 
                        In 2020, the All-Russian Research Institute of Flow Metering (VNIIR) and Ural Research Institute of Metrology (UNIIM) were affiliated with the D.I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology in the form of its branches.
